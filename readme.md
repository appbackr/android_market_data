Using the Android Market Data project
=====================================

What does it do?
----------------

This project downloads HTML from the Android Market web site (market.android.com) and extracts information about apps from it. 

To get a single app: android_market_data.scrape_and_extract_apps.extract_app('):

Currently we're getting most of the data we can about apps.

More soon...


Requirements
------------

- BeautifulSoup
